	\emph{Chorus}:\\
	\repetitionbegin{} What shall we do with a drunken sailor, \repetitionend{} x3 \\
	early in the morning!

	\showversenumber Sling him in the longboat until he’s sober.\\
	\showversenumber Keep him there and make him bale her.\\
	\showversenumber Pull out the plug and wet him all over.\\
	\showversenumber Take him and shake him, try and wake him.\\
	\showversenumber Give him a dose of salt and water.\\
	\showversenumber Stick on his back a mustard plaster.\\
	\showversenumber Shave his belly with a rusty razor.\\
	\showversenumber Send him up the crow’s nest until he falls down.\\
	\showversenumber Tie him to the taffrail when she’s yardarm under.\\
	\showversenumber Put him in the scuppers with a hose-pipe on him.\\
	\showversenumber Soak him in oil till he sprouts flippers.\\
	\showversenumber Put him in the guard room until he’s sober.\\
	\showversenumber Turn him over and drive him windward.\\
	\showversenumber Put him in the scuffs until the horse bites on him.\\
	\showversenumber Heave him by the leg and with a rug console on him.\\
	\showversenumber That’s what we’ll do with the drunken sailor.
