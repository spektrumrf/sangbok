	Birth control, all my troubles seem so far way\\
	when I'm going up my girlfriend's hole.\\
	Oh, I believe in birth control.
	
	Suddenly, there's a shotgun hanging over me;\\
	it was unexpected pregnancy.\\
	Oh, I believe in birth control.
	
	Why I had to come\\
	I don't know, she wouldn't blow.\\
	I stayed in too long\\
	now I long for birth control.
	
	Syfilis, it all started with a little kiss,\\
	now it hurts when I try to piss.\\
	Oh, I believe in syfilis.
	
	Leprosy, there are pieces falling off of me,\\
	I'm not half the man I used to be.\\
	Oh, I think I have leprosy.
