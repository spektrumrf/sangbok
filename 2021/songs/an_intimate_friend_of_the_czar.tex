	An intimate friend of the czar was I,\\
	a personal friend to the great Nikolay.\\
	We practically slept in the same double bed;\\
	it was I at the foot and he at the head.
	
	But all that seems distant\\
	and all that seems far\\
	from those glorious days\\
	at the palace of the czar when\\
	I was shooting with Raspoutin,\\
	ate farrina with czarrina,\\
	blinzes with the princess and the czar. Hey, hey hey!\\
	We were sharing tea and herring,\\
	dipped banana in smetana,\\
	Bortsch and wurst round the samovar.

	As a friend of the czar, I was all his gracious life,\\
	but friendlier still I was with his young wife.\\
	We practically slept in the same double bed,\\
	'till the czar kicked me out and slept there instead!
	
	But all that seems distant\ldots{}
	
    \showversenumber
	BUT! - One awful day revolution broke out,\\
	I failed to see what the fuss was about.\\
	So one frosty morning I bid Russia good bye -\\
	it was simply a case of Lenin or I.
	
	But all that seems distant\ldots{}
