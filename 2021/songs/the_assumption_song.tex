	There was an old farmer who lived on a rock.\\
	\vspace{.2cm}
	He sat in the meadow just shaking his\ldots\\
	fist at some boys who were down by the crick,\\
	\vspace{.2cm}	
	their feet in the water, their hands on their\ldots\\
	marbles and playthings and at half past four\\
	\vspace{.2cm}
	there came a young lady she looked like a\ldots\\
	pretty young creature. She sat on the grass.\\
	\vspace{.2cm}
	She pulled up her dress and she showed them her\ldots\\
	rumples and laces and white fluffy duck.\\
	\vspace{.2cm}
	She said she was learning a new way to\ldots\\
	bring up her children so they would not spit,\\
	\vspace{.2cm}
	while the boys in the barnyard were shoveling\ldots\\
	refuse and litter from yesterday's hunt,\\
	\vspace{.2cm}
	while the girl in the meadow was rubbing her\ldots\\
	eyes at the fellow down by the dock.\\
	\vspace{.2cm}
	He looked like a man with a sizable\ldots\\
	home in the country, with a big fence out front.\\
	\vspace{.2cm}
	If he asked her politely she'd show him her\ldots\\
	little pet dog who was subject to fits.\\
	\vspace{.2cm}
	And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her\ldots\\
	small tender hands with a movement so quick.\\
	\vspace{.2cm}
	And then she'd bend over and suck on his\ldots\\
	candy so tasty made of butterscotch.\\
	\vspace{.2cm}
	And then he spread whipped cream all over her\ldots\\
	cookies. Now this is the end of this song.\\
	If you think this is dirty you're FUCKING WELL WRONG!
