	Come guess me this riddle: what beats pipes and fiddle,\\
	what’s hotter than mustard and milder than cream,\\
	what best wets your whistle, what’s clearer than crystal,\\
	what’s sweeter than honey and stronger than steam?

	What’ll make the lame walk, what will make the dumb talk,\\
	The elixir of life and philospher’s stone.\\
	And what helped Mr. Brunnell to build the Thames Tunnel,\\
	Oh wasn’t it whiskey from ould Inisowen?

	So stick to the cratur’ the best thing in nature\\
	For sinking your sorrows and raising your joys.\\
	Oh lord, it’s no wonder, if lightning and thunder\\
	Weren’t made from the plunder of whiskey me boys.
