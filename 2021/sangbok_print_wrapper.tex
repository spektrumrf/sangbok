% Since book was to be printed as A6 but all image placements in latex are calculated as if the book was A5,
% I added 30mm to standard A5 height and width (148mm by 210mm), and 1.5cm to all four margins. This leaves 
% room for crop marks when page is scaled down to A6. Otherwise everything is identical, all images are
% left in their proper places

% This one is for printing, larger paper size, bigger margins
\usepackage[paperwidth=135mm, paperheight=178mm, top=1.5cm, bottom=1.5cm, left=1.5cm, right=1.5cm]{geometry}

% This is the regular size
%\usepackage[paperwidth=148mm, paperheight=210mm, top=2cm, bottom=1.5cm, left=1.5cm, right=1.5cm]{geometry}
